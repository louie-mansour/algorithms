## Things which have tripped me up:
1. Make sure you're answering the right questions
   1. Don't be lazy with unit tests, cover thoroughly to give the interviewing confidence
2. Finding pivot in rotated array:
   1. Think of it as finding which side the current element belongs to
   2. Keep track of the smallest element while doing this
3. ThreeSum:
   1. Anything larger than TwoSum, it's best to sort the array
   2. Then use hi and lo pointers to arrive at the solution

## Nice to Haves
1. Try recursive version of DFS
